Cold computer is a website for my personal short thoughts and moods. Thoughts are called "scraps," and they can be assigned a "mood" which determines their color. You can search the scraps for words in the title or description. I can sign in to add more scraps, but you can't, sorry.

you can visit this website at www.cold.computer
